# A string such as "word" contains the following abbreviations:
#
# ["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
# Given a target string and a set of strings in a dictionary, find an abbreviation of this target string with thesmallest possible length such that it does not conflict with abbreviations of the strings in the dictionary.
#
# Each number or letter in the abbreviation is considered length = 1. For example, the abbreviation "a32bc" has length = 4.
#
# Note:
#
# In the case of multiple answers as shown in the second example below, you may return any one of them.
# Assume length of target string = m, and dictionary size = n. You may assume that m ≤ 21, n ≤ 1000, and log2(n) + m ≤ 20.
#
# Examples:
#
# "apple", ["blade"] -> "a4"(because "5" or "4e" conflicts with "blade")
#
# "apple", ["plain", "amber", "blade"] -> "1p3"(other valid answers include "ap3", "a3e", "2p2", "3le", "3l1").
#
# 这道题实际上是之前那两道Valid Word Abbreviation和Generalized
# Abbreviation的合体，我们的思路其实很简单，首先找出target的所有的单词缩写的形式，然后按照长度来排序，小的排前面，
# 我们用优先队列来自动排序，里面存一个pair，保存单词缩写及其长度，然后我们从最短的单词缩写开始，
# 跟dictionary中所有的单词一一进行验证，利用Valid Word Abbreviation中的方法，看其是否是合法的单词的缩写，
# 如果是，说明有冲突，直接break，进行下一个单词缩写的验证
